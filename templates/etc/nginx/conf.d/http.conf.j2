# Module configuration file - http configuration
#
# Options in this file are based on:
# * harmonising the Ubuntu and CentOS default configuration files
# * https://github.com/h5bp/server-configs-nginx
#
# This file is included directly within the main Nginx configuration file '/etc/nginx/nginx.conf'.
#
# Server block (virtual host) definitions *SHOULD NOT* be listed in this file. Instead:
# 1. Create a server block definition file in '/etc/nginx/sites-available/'
# 2. Create a symbolic link to this definition file in '/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/'
# 3. Restart the Nginx service
#
# Similarly, configuration for additional features of this module, such as Gzip, proxies and SSL/TLS *SHOULD NOT* be
# listed in this file. Instead:
# 1. Create a suitable configuration file in '/etc/nginx/conf.d/http/' (or symoblic link a file to this directory)
# 2. Restart the Nginx service
